# CakePHP Backbone Plugin

This is a very simple CakePHP plugin enabling you to add Backbone to your cake projects.

It does very little apart from supply you with the backbone base files, 
and offer you and a 'controller component' with a customized 'json'.

This will mate sure Cake controller set model properties will be output in the style 
Backbone is happy with. 

## Dependencies

In order to have the base files automatically loaded you need to install Mark Story's excellent 'Asset Compress' plugin

AssetCompress is available at [github](http://github.com/markstory/asset_compress)

### Installation

In your bootstrap.php make sure you include the plugin

	CakePlugin::load('CakephpBackbone');
	
Make sure you add set the correct files in  your compress_asset.ini

	[js]
	paths[] = /cake/Backbone/

	[backbone-base.js]
	files[] = lib/jquery-min.js
	files[] = lib/underscore-min.js
	files[] = lib/backbone-min.js
	
You can then show that you are going to use the Backbone component and 
asset compress helper in your controllers.

	var $helpers = array('AssetCompress.AssetCompress');
	
	public $components = array (
		'RequestHandler',
		'CakephpBackbone.Backbone'
	);

Then add the backbone files to your view.

	<?php echo $this->AssetCompress->script('backbone-base'); ?>
